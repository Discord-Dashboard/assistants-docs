## Setup your environment

Learn how to develop your Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installing Node.js">
    To use discord-dashboard, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

    <Tip>

To check if you already have Node installed, run `node -v` in your terminal.

</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setting up your project">
    To use discord-dashboard, you'll need to install it via `npm` (which comes pre-installed with Node).

    If you want to use a different package manager like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) you can replace the commands with the proper command name.

    Navigate to a suitable directory on your machine and create your project's folder.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Opening the terminal">

<Tip>
  If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can press{" "}
  <code>Ctrl + `</code> (backtick) to open its integrated terminal.
</Tip>

    On Microsoft Windows, either:

- `Shift + Right-click` inside your project directory and choose the "Open command window here" option
- Press `Win + R` and run `cmd.exe` then `cd` into your project directory

On Apple macOS, either:

- Open Launchpad or Spotlight and search for "Terminal"
- In your "Applications" folder, under "Utilities", open the Terminal app

On Linux, you can quickly open the terminal with `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verifying Node is installed">
  With the terminal open, run `node -v` to ensure you've successfully installed Node.js.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Initiating a project folder">
  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm init
```

```bash yarn
yarn init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm init
```

```bash bun
bun init
```

</CodeGroup>

This next command creates a `package.json` file for you, which keeps track of dependencies of your project as well as some other stuff!

It will ask you a sequence of questions, you should answer them as you see fit. If you're not sure on something or want to skip it; leave it blank and press enter.

Once you're done answering the questions, you're ready to install discord-dashboard!

  </Step>

    <Step title="Installing modules">

Now that you've installed Node.js and know how to open your console and run commands, you can finally install discord-dashboard and Soft-UI!
Run the following command in your terminal:

  <CodeGroup>

```javascript npm
npm install discord-dashboard dbd-soft-ui discord.js
```

```javascript yarn
yarn add discord-dashboard dbd-soft-ui discord.js
```

```javascript pnpm
pnpm add discord-dashboard dbd-soft-ui discord.js
```

```javascript bun
bun add discord-dashboard dbd-soft-ui discord.js
```

</CodeGroup>

And now that we've installed the required modules, we can start setting up the dashboard!

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup the project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating config.json">
    We will be creating a new file, `config.json`, which will house all our
    important (and secret) settings! Paste the following code into the file and
    replace as necessary:

    ```json config.json
    {
    "discord": {
        "token": "discordToken",
        "client": {
            "id": "clientId",
            "secret": "clientSecret"
        }
    },
    "dbd": {
        "port": 80,
        // Keep this for local development or add in yout domain
        "domain": "http://localhost",
        // Do not Change the redirectUri
        "redirectUri": "/discord/callback",
        "license": "dbdLicense",
        "ownerIDs": ["Dashboard Admin Discord User IDs"]
    }

}

````

The configuration above will not work unless you change the values of the properties.

Please also add the callback URL to your [App](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the Discord Developer Portal. (e.g. "http://localhost/discord/callback")

  </Step>
    <Step title="Creating index.js">
  Create a new file, `index.js` (or anything you'd like) and paste the discord-dashboard handler into it.

  ```javascript index.js
  // Define Packages
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const SoftUI = require('dbd-soft-ui');
const config = require('./config.json');
let DBD = require('discord-dashboard');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });
client.login(config.discord.token);

const Handler = new DBD.Handler(
    /*
            Keyv storage instance
            Example: { store: new KeyvMongo('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname') }

            Can be left empty to use the default storage (Keyv with SQLite)
        */
);

(async ()=>{
    await DBD.useLicense(config.dbd.license);
    DBD.Dashboard = DBD.UpdatedClass();

    const Dashboard = new DBD.Dashboard({
        port: config.dbd.port,
        client: config.discord.client,
        redirectUri: `${config.dbd.domain}${config.dbd.redirectUri}`,
        domain: config.dbd.domain,
        ownerIDs: config.dbd.ownerIDs,
        useThemeMaintenance: true,
        useTheme404: true,
        bot: client,
        theme: SoftUI({
            storage: Handler,
            customThemeOptions: {
                index: async ({ req, res, config }) => {
                    return {
                        values: [],
                        graph: {},
                        cards: [],
                    }
                },
            },
            websiteName: "Assistants",
            colorScheme: "pink",
            supporteMail: "support@support.com",
            icons: {
                favicon: 'https://assistantscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cropped-cropped-logov6.png',
                noGuildIcon: "https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/discord-icon-2048x2048-nnt62s2u.png",
                sidebar: {
                    darkUrl: 'https://assistantscenter.com/img/logo.png',
                    lightUrl: 'https://assistanscenter.com/img/logo.png',
                    hideName: true,
                    borderRadius: false,
                    alignCenter: true
                },
            },
            index: {
                graph: {
                    enabled: true,
                    lineGraph: false,
                    title: 'Memory Usage',
                    tag: 'Memory (MB)',
                    max: 100
                },
            },
            sweetalert: {
                errors: {},
                success: {
                    login: "Successfully logged in.",
                }
            },
            preloader: {
                image: "/img/soft-ui.webp",
                spinner: false,
                text: "Page is loading",
            },
            admin: {
                pterodactyl: {
                    enabled: false,
                    apiKey: "apiKey",
                    panelLink: "https://panel.website.com",
                    serverUUIDs: []
                }
            },
            commands: [],
        }),
        settings: []
    });
    Dashboard.init();
})();
````

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generating a license">
  Before you can use discord-dashboard, you need to generate a [license](https://store.assistantscenter.com/).
  Once you've generated a license, add it to the configuration file.
