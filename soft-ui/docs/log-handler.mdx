description: "This is a log handler for your bot. It will collect all the logs from your bot and display them in the dashboard's admin page."

## Dashboard Setup

Place this in your admin config which is located in the theme config and change the key to your own **SECURE** string.

```js
theme: SoftUI({
  admin: {
    logs: {
      enabled: Boolean,
      key: String,
    },
  },
});
```

### Example Usage

```js
theme: SoftUI({
  admin: {
    logs: {
      enabled: true,
      key: "place your key here!",
    },
  },
});
```

## Bot Setup

Install the NPM package in **Bot**

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @dbd-soft-ui/logs
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @dbd-soft-ui/logs
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @dbd-soft-ui/logs
```

```bash bun
bun add @dbd-soft-ui/logs
```

</CodeGroup>

Almost done! Place this code into your ready event on the bot.

```js
const DLU = require("@dbd-soft-ui/logs");

client.on("ready", () => {
  DLU.register(client, {
    dashboard_url: String,
    key: String,
  });
});

process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, p) => {
  DLU.send(client, {
    title: String,
    description: reason,
  });
});
```

It should look like this, except with your details:

```js
const DLU = require("@dbd-soft-ui/logs");

client.on("ready", () => {
  DLU.register(client, {
    dashboard_url: "https://softui.assistantscenter.com",
    key: "YOURKEYHERE",
  });
});

process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, p) => {
  DLU.send(client, {
    title: "Unhandled Rejection",
    description: reason,
  });
});
```

And we are done! Now just restart your dashboard and bot then the logs collection will begin.
